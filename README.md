This project includes a brief summary of code review in a Java repository forked from a 
GitHub public repository.
This code was developed 7 years ago and includes a base code in Java version 4 that
works in J2SE 1.4.
As part of our project, we will be focusing on features of clean code:
1. Documentation: Repository being old has no underlying description. Project demands navigation 
   through class to understand its purpose. We will be adding comments and documentation for 
   enhanced readability.
2. Refactor: Base code requires immense refactoring to include good coding practices. 
   Issues of naming conventions (meaningful names), refactoring methods (functions), formatting and 
   error handling will be closed.
